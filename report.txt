# Password Security Analysis Report

Overview:
This report describes the testing of three passwords using the PasswordMonster tool to estimate password strength and resistance to brute-force attacks in terms of complexity and length.

----------------------------------------------------
1. Password: Hello123
   - Classification: Weak
   - Length: 8 characters
   - Character Set: Letters (upper/lower), Number
   - Estimated Crack Time: 0.03 seconds
- Analysis: Short and patterns common to most people (e.g., "Hello" and low-order digits), so easily guessed.
   - Recommendation: Steer clear of dictionary words and patterns that are predictable. Lengthen and randomize.

2. Password: Smile#78Life!
   - Classification: Strong
   - Length: 13 characters
   - Character Set: Mixed case letters, Numbers, Symbols
   - Estimated Crack Time: 3 years

3. Password: &P!$$ED#*0oF()
   - Classification: Very Strong
   - Length: 14 characters
   - Character Set: Upper and lowercase letters, Numbers, Complex Symbols
- Estimated Crack Time: 19 thousand years
   - Analysis: This password is strongly randomized and secure against both brute-force and dictionary attacks. It does not contain frequent patterns and has rare symbols.
   - Recommendation: Perfect password format. Store such complex passwords using a password manager.

Conclusion:
Among the three test passwords:
- One was insecure and unfit for secure accounts.
- One was secure and complied with general password security guidelines.
- One was extremely secure and showed excellent password health.

In order to have strong security, always opt for longer passwords with different types of characters and never use personal or generic information.
